PWA for food delivery services

IDEAS: 

singleton - connection to db
factory - user types maybe
builder - order builder - get lat and lng from address using an api or smth
prototype - for restaurant - so i dont have to wait for the api to return the lat lng
decorator - user with connectionId for signalR ig  -- actually mai bn pt order - adding courier 
adapter - for orderItem maybe? to use entityframework
