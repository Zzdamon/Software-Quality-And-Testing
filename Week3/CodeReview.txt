Code Review

Stage 1. Naming conventions

- rename Clasa1 to smth more meaningful
- rename Calculeaza - use small caps
- rename function arguments
- rename rezultat
- rename valoare
- remove hard coded values / magic numbers
- validate your input values
- replace the if-then-else checks for productType with switch

Stage 2. KISS , Single Responsibility = > reduce functions complexity 

- remove switch by using generic approach for each product type
- out-source the validations
- out-source the way the fidelity discount is computed

Stage 3. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

- remove the dependency regarding the validation of input values
- remove the dependency on the static values - they are given by the marketing team
- remove the dependency on the way the fidelity discount is computed - Marketing will decide


GENERAL:
 General Programming:
 - Always override toString (instead of using the to_string method, override toString)
